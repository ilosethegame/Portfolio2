        <p>I am currently a Receiving Manager in retail with a passion for technology, especially software. Over the past year
          and a half I have been studying Web Development in depth and have fallen in love with it. I am a self-starter that
          enjoys the constant learning of new technologies and how to use them to create amazing things. I believe my experience
          of problem solving in retail and other fields has provided me with the drive and skills necessary to do well in
          Web Development. I am currently seeking to join a team of highly motivated individuals to create software that
          makes an impact.

        <h3>Bed, Bath, & Beyond</h3>
        <h5>Receiving Manager | Wilmington, NC</h5>
        <p>I was originally hired as a part-time stocking associate and within two months I was promoted to Receiving Manager.
          At the time the receiving team, which consisted of three people was 10 shipments behind schedule. With an average
          shipment size of 500 boxes per day and limited space this was an issue. Using my critical thinking ability I soon
          figured out more efficient methods to receive and process such a large amount of freight and implemented them.
          Over my three years working at this store my team has changed several times, but my processes still stand and work
          to this day. We are currently zero shipments behind and often finish our normal duties early and can assist in
          other parts of the store if needed.

        <h3>Mirror Image Environmental Solutions</h3>
        <h5>Fluid Technician Manager/Environmental Foreman | Williston, ND</h5>
        <p>My three years working in the oilfields in North Dakota were life changing. For the first two years I took on the
          role of Fluid Technician Manager in a Halliburton truck wash facility. The position was fairly new and did not
          have much structure or organization. In short, the Halliburton truck drivers would drive their fracking equipment
          into the facility to decontaminate and pressure wash the trucks and equipment. After the decontaminaton, they moved
          onto the fluid area where a Fluid Technician would check fluid levels(ex. motor oil, transmission fluid, pump oil,
          diesel exhaust fluid) in the tractors and trailers and ensure they are filled to proper levels. As I gained experience
          with what the job required, I began to document what I thought to be the safest and most efficient ways to perform
          the fluid checks. I ended up writing the Standard Operating Procedures for the position within the OSHA guidelines
          for safe oilfield work. My last year in the oilfield was as an Environmental Foreman. I received training to perform
          and run oilfield clean-up jobs including, but not limited to wash bay "sludge-outs", confined space entry tank
          cleanings, onsite silica sand clean-up, and emergency response for environmental spills. Alot of these jobs were
          not easy, especially in the harsh North Dakota winters. I was able to gain and use critical thinking abilities
          to solve problems onsite in a safe, efficient, and professional matter. The fact that I had a chance to make the
          world better by helping to clean up some of the oilfield messes has provided me with immense confidence in my own
          abilities to problem solve and adapt to ever changing situations.

        <h3>Precision Tune Auto Care</h3>
        <h5>Tire, Lube, Alignment Technician | Raleigh, NC</h5>
        <p>As one of my first positions that required some sort of technical competence, I gained a ton of knowledge. With almost
          every vehicle that came through the door we did a 21-point inspection. This entailed looking for leaks, wear and
          tear on belts, hoses, and any other accessory parts, checking tire air pressure and tire wear, suspension, fluid
          systems, and many other items. I gained alot of knowledge about how the systems intertwined and worked together
          to make the vehicle work properly. Working in an auto repair shop really taught me how to look at a potentially
          big problems and systematically break it down into smaller pieces that are potentially easier to solve and narrow
          down the potential causes. I even got to use sophisticated software built into Snap-On's Modis Diagnostic device
          to assist mechanics in troubleshooting deep engine problems. This device provided a unique insight into the ability
          of technology to help any industry.
